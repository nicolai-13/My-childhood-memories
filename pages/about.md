## About My Childhood memories

You will find items in this collection that bring back memories of our youth, such as playing games, hanging out with my siblings, attending school, and exploring the world.  Every item tells a tale.  Some are humorous, some are a touch depressed, and some are joyful.


## About the Curator


Nicolai Caba√±a is a Saint Paul University Surigao student pursuing a bachelor's degree in library and information science.  "Childhood Memories" is my choice because our formative years are filled with memorable experiences.  Our identities are shaped in part by these recollections.
